Utilizing Python and Flask in order to make a website

Flask is a high performing front-end framework used by several top companies in the world. JavaScript is more ubiquitous ; however, Flask was extremely easy to use and build this *** website with. Linode was super easy to use. I recently took some time to explore and learn Flask from Youtube videos as a challenge to then see if I could build a simple example of the framework.
