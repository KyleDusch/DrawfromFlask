# DrawfromFlask
Utilizing Python and Flask in order to make a simple interactive webpage.

Flask is a high performing front-end framework used by several top companies in the world. Flask was extremely easy to use and build this *** website with.

Linode was seemless to integrate and develop the website in. I recently took some time to explore and learn Flask from Youtube videos as a challenge to then see if I could build a simple example of the framework. The goal then would be to develop and integrate a backend component, such as Django or even React. The project allows for simple deployment of a concept while meeting a niche focus of the website, which can be used by a small group of people for specfic tasks.
